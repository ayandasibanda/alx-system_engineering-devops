---

## Learning Objectives :bulb:

In this project, you will:

* Learn to navigate API documentation effectively to locate required endpoints.
* Practice utilizing an API with pagination efficiently.
* Understand how to extract and parse JSON data returned from an API.
* Implement recursive API calls for retrieving extensive data.
* Master the technique of sorting a dictionary by its values.

### [0. How many subs?](./0-subs.py)

* Develop a function that interfaces with the Reddit API to retrieve the total number of subscribers for a specified subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is provided, the function gracefully returns 0.

### [1. Top Ten](./1-top_ten.py)

* Craft a function capable of querying the Reddit API to display the titles of the first 10 hot posts in a given subreddit.

### [2. Recurse it!](./2-recurse.py)

* Construct a recursive function to interact with the Reddit API, gathering the titles of all hot articles within a specific subreddit. If no results are found, the function gracefully returns None.

### [3. Count it!](./100-count.py)

* Write a recursive function that communicates with the Reddit API, extracting titles of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of provided keywords. The search is case-insensitive, and keywords are delimited by spaces. (E.g., "javascript" and "Javascript" are counted as one).
